# Exercise 1.13 - Sum of two numbers

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. After this, the program prints the sum of the numbers given by the user.

When you ask for multiple numbers, create a separate variable for each:

```python
first = int(input('Give the first number:'))
second = int(input('Give the second number:'))

# do something with the numbers
```

Examples of expected output:

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*8*
Give the second number:
*3*
The sum of the numbers is 11
```

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*3*
Give the second number:
*-1*
The sum of the numbers is 2
```
